2. Clean white backgrounds = Sterile/Safe
3. Orange accents = Call-to-action (appointments)
4. Light blue background = Calming
5. Used by top hospitals worldwide

## Implementation Priority

1. Change background: BLACK → WHITE/LIGHT BLUE
2. Change primary color: EMERALD → MEDICAL BLUE
3. Update all buttons: GREEN → BLUE/ORANGE
4. Add more white space
5. Softer shadows (not too dark)
